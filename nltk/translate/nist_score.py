    DARPA commissioned NIST to develop an MT evaluation facility based on the BLEU
    score. The official script used by NIST to compute BLEU and NIST score is
    mteval-14.pl. The main differences are:

     - BLEU uses geometric mean of the ngram overlaps, NIST uses arithmetic mean.
     - NIST has a different brevity penalty
     - NIST score from mteval-14.pl has a self-contained tokenizer

    Note: The mteval-14.pl includes a smoothing function for BLEU score that is NOT
          used in the NIST score computation.
